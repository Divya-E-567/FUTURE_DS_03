🚀 College Event Feedback Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

I designed a multi-page dashboard to analyze student satisfaction, participation trends, organizer performance, and event-wise feedback using Power BI. Key Highlights:

✔ 7 events analyzed across 7 departments

✔ Startup Pitch identified as the top-performing event

✔ Online participation remains dominant (60%)

✔ Female participation slightly higher than male (55:45)

✔ Entrepreneur events lead with the highest cumulative feedback
